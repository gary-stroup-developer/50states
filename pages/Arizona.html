            Arizona, the Grand Canyon state, achieved statehood on February 14, 1912, the last of the 48 coterminous United States
            to be admitted to the union. Originally part of Spanish and Mexican territories, the land was ceded to the United States
            in 1848, and became a separate territory in 1863. Copper was discovered in 1854, and copper mining was Arizona’s premier
            industry until the 1950s. After World War II, the widespread availability of refrigeration and air conditioning caused
            Arizona’s population to boom and Phoenix to become one of the fastest growing cities in America. Arizona is the sixth
            largest state in the country in terms of area. Its population has always been predominantly urban, particularly since
            the mid-20th century, when urban and suburban areas began growing rapidly at the expense of the countryside. Some
            scholars believe that the state’s name comes from a Basque phrase meaning “place of oaks” while others attribute it to a
            Tohono O’odham (Papago) Indian phrase meaning “place of the young (or little) spring.
