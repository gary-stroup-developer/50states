            Initially colonized by French fur traders, Ohio became a British colonial possession following the French and Indian War
            in 1754. At the end of the American Revolution, Britain ceded control of the territory to the newly formed United
            States, which incorporated it into the Northwest Territory.
            
            Ohio became a state on March 1, 1803, although no formal declaration was made until 1953 when President Dwight
            Eisenhower officially signed the documents making it a state, retroactive to the original date. Ohio is sometimes called
            the “Mother of Modern Presidents,” having sent seven Ohioans (both natives and residents)to the White House since 1869.
            Ohio is also known as the home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the NationalUnderground Railroad Freedom
            Center in Cincinnati and the National Football League Hall of Fame in Canton.

                    Ohio got its name from the Iroquois word, “O-Y-O,” meaning “great river.” The Iroquois Indians had begun to settle
                    between the Ohio River and Great Lakes by 1650, although it is estimated that only a few hundred lived in present-day
                    Ohio during any one period.

                    The city of Cleveland was founded by Connecticut-born Moses Cleaveland, who, in 1796, went to survey land claimed by the
                    Connecticut Land Co. as part of the Western Reserve. Although the city was originally named “Cleaveland,” in the early
                    1930s the Cleveland Advertiser dropped the “a” in order to fit the name on its masthead, and the new spelling caught on.

                    Ohio’s nickname, the Buckeye State, is attributed to the prevalence of the local buckeye tree, whose fruit was believed
                    to bear a striking resemblance to the eye of male deer by early American Indians.

                    The “Mother of Modern Presidents,” Ohio was the birthplace of seven U.S. presidents: Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B.
                    Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William H. Taft and Warren G. Harding.
