            The Dutch first settled along the Hudson River in 1624; two years later they established the colony of New Amsterdam on
            Manhattan Island. In 1664, the English took control of the area and renamed it New York. One of the original 13
            colonies, New York played a crucial political and strategic role during the American Revolution. Between 1892 and 1954,
            millions of immigrants arrived in New York Harbor and passed through Ellis Island on their journey to becoming U.S
            citizens. It is estimated that up to 40 percent of Americans can trace at least one ancestor to that port of entry. New
            York City, the largest city in the state, is home to the New York Stock Exchange and is a major international economic
            center.

                    New York City was the first capital of the United States after the Constitution was ratified in 1788. On April 30, 1789,
                    George Washington was inaugurated as the nation’s first president at Federal Hall, located on Wall Street.

                    The popular tabloid New York Post was originally established in 1801 as a Federalist newspaper called the New York
                    Evening Post by Alexander Hamilton, an author of the Federalist papers and the nation’s first secretary of the treasury

                    After the towns of Woodstock and Wallkill refused permission to host what ultimately became the country’s most renowned
                    musical festival, a dairy farmer in nearby Bethel agreed to provide access to his land for “Three Days of Peace and
                    Music.” With musical acts kicking off on August 15, 1969, the Woodstock Music Festival attracted more than 400,000
                    attendees—most of whom were admitted for free since the organizers of the event were unprepared to control access for
                    such a large crowd.

                    New York City contains roughly 660 miles of subway track connecting 468 subway stations—the lowest of which is located
                    180 feet below street level. In 2011, more than 1.6 billion people rode the subway.
