            Mountains, high plateaus and deserts form most of Utah’s landscape. At Four Corners, in the southeast, Utah meets
            Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona at right angles, the only such meeting of states in the country. Utah became the 45th
            member of the union on Jan. 4, 1896, with Salt Lake City as its capital. Utah is known for having some of the best
            skiing in the country, and the mountains near Salt Lake City receive an average of 500 inches of snow per year. During
            the 19th century many Mormons settled in Utah, and today approximately 60 percent of the state’s residents are members
            of the church. The Sundance Film Festival, one of the premier independent film festivals in the world, is held each
            January in Park City.

                    Although annual precipitation averages less than 5 inches within the Great Salt Lake Desert, the northern Wasatch
                    Mountains receive more than 60. During the drought of 1976-1977, communities were forced to ration water as the state
                    suffered from its driest period on record with only 7.7 inches of precipitation.

                    On May 10, 1869, the first transcontinental railroad was completed when the Union and Central Pacific Railroads joined
                    rails at Promontory Summit in Utah Territory. A tie made of California laurelwood bearing a silver plaque with the
                    railroad’s completion date and four precious metal spikes were presented during the Golden Spike Ceremony; however, an
                    ordinary tie and iron spikes were used to unite the rail lines.

                In the summer of 1848, flocks of seagulls came to Mormon pioneers’ rescue by gorging themselves on the crickets that
                were destroying their newly planted crops. To honor the “miracle,” the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                dedicated the Seagull Monument, located on Temple Square, in 1913. In 1955, the California Seagull was designated the
                state bird.

                    Arches National Park in southeastern Utah contains over 2,000 natural rock arches. The widest, known as Landscape Arch,
                    extends 306 feet from one base to the other.
