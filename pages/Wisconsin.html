            Wisconsin became aU.S. territory following the American Revolution and soon after began attracting settlers looking for
            work in its mining, lumber and dairy industries. It was admitted to the union as the 30th state in 1848. In the years
            leading up to the Civil War, Wisconsin was an important stop on the Underground Railroad, with many slaves passing
            through the state on their way to freedom in Canada. Today, Wisconsin leads the nation in dairy production and is known
            for the quality of its cheddar cheese–residents even sometimes refer to themselves as “cheeseheads.” Famous
            Wisconsinites include architect Frank Lloyd Wright, magician Harry Houdini andU.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur.

                    Wisconsin earned the nickname “Badger State,” not because of its proliferation of badgers, but because its earliest
                    white inhabitants were itinerant lead miners who burrowed into the hills for shelter rather than waste time and
                    resources on a more permanent structure

                    Enraged by the recent passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Alvan Bovay convened a meeting at a schoolhouse in Ripon to
                    create a new political party that would defend against the expansion of slavery. It was during this meeting, on March
                    20, 1854, that the Republican Party was established.

                    In 1911, Victor Berger became the first Socialist elected to Congress. After winning the election again in 1918, the
                    House of Representatives refused to seat him due to an unresolved legal battle involving his outspoken condemnation of
                    U.S. involvement in World War I. By 1921 the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in his favor and the charges against him were
                    dismissed.
