            One of the 13 original colonies, Virginia was the first part of the country permanently settled by the English, who
            established Jamestown on the banks of the James River in 1607. The home state of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and
            other founding fathers, Virginia played an important role in the American Revolution (1775-83). During the Civil War
            (1861-65), the city of Richmond, Virginia, became the capital of the Confederacy, and more than half of the conflict’s
            battles were fought in the state. Today, many government institutions are headquartered in Virginia, particularly in
            Arlington, located across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. In addition to eight presidents, famous Virginians
            include singer Ella Fitzgerald, tennis star Arthur Ashe, actress Shirley MacLaine and authors Willa Cather and Tom
            Wolfe.

                    Patrick Henry delivered his famous “Give me liberty or give me death!” speech before the second Virginia Convention at
                    St. John’s Church (formerly Henrico Parish) in Richmond on March 23, 1775.

                    On October 19, 1781, following three weeks of continuous bombardment, British General Lord Charles Cornwallis
                    surrendered to General George Washington in the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia, essentially bringing the American
                    Revolution to an end.

                    The Arlington National Cemetery, one of America’s most renowned military cemeteries, was originally built in the early
                    19th century as a mansion by George Washington’s adopted grandson, George Washington Parke Custis. Robert E. Lee, who
                    married Custis’ daughter, Mary Anna, lived in Arlington House at various periods until 1861, when Virginia seceded from
                    the Union and the couple vacated the estate. On June 15, 1864, the property was established as a military cemetery.

                    The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg is the nation’s second-oldest institution of higher education, after
                    Harvard; King William III and Queen Mary II of England signed a charter for its creation on February 8, 1693. At the
                    persuasion of Thomas Jefferson, the first law school in America was established there in 1779.
