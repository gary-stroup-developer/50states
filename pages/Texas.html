            Spanish missionaries were the first European settlers in Texas, founding San Antonio in 1718. Hostile natives and
            isolation from other Spanish colonies kept Texas sparsely populated until following the Revolutionary War and the War of
            Mexican Independence when the newly established Mexican government began to allow settlers from the U.S. to claim land
            there. This led to a population explosion, but dramatically reduced the percentage of the population with Mexican
            heritage, causing friction with the government in Mexico City. After several smaller insurrections, the Texas Revolution
            broke out, and the state became an independent nation in 1836. However, the newly formed Texas Republic was unable to
            defend itself from further incursions by Mexican troops and eventually negotiated with the U.S. to join the union in
            1845.

                    The Johnson Space Center in Houston, originally established as the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in 1961, is the site
                    of Mission Control for all flights into space. On July 20, 1969, its flight controllers oversaw the Apollo 11 flight
                    that landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon and returned the astronauts safely home. Referred to as the
                    “Eighth Wonder of the World,” the Astrodome in Houston was the world’s first domed stadium when it was opened in 1965.
                    Drawing crowds for sporting events, concerts, rodeos and entertainment, the Astrodome was last used in 2005 as a shelter
                    for Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Texas is the leading crude oil- and natural gas-producing state in the U.S. In 2011, it
                    also produced more cattle, sheep, hay, cotton and wool than any other state. The name Texas derives from a Caddo Indian
                    word that means “friends” or “allies,” which was incorporated into the state motto: Friendship.

                    During Texas’ war for independence from Mexico, a group of 200 volunteers who were defending the fort and former
                    Franciscan mission known as the Alamo near San Antonio was attacked by a much larger force of Mexican troops. The siege,
                    which had begun on February 23, 1836, lasted for 13 days before the Mexican forces broke through the courtyard and
                    annihilated most of the Texans, including famed frontiersman and former congressman from Tennessee, Davy Crockett.

                    On September 8, 1900, a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 130 miles per hour pummeled Galveston, Texas, killing more
                    than 8,000 people and destroying the once-thriving city. It remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States
                    history.

                    While traveling through Dallas in an open convertible on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was shot and
                    killed by Lee Harvey Oswald. Two hours later, Vice President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as the 36th president of the
                    United States aboard Air Force One while stationed at Dallas Love Field airport.
