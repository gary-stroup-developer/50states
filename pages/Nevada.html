        Nevada is the seventh-largest of the 50 states but is one of the most sparsely populated. Carson City, in the western
        part of the state, is the capital. Gambling is legal in Nevada, and Las Vegas, the state’s largest city, is known
        internationally for its opulent casinos and as an entertainment destination. Nevada is also home to the Hoover Dam,
        which was the single largest public works project in the history of the United States, and Lake Mead, the largest
        reservoir in the country.

                Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world following China, Australia and South Africa, and supplies
                three-quarters of all gold mined in the United States.

                Nevada was the first state to ratify the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which gave African-American men the
                right to vote, on March 1, 1869.

                    Nevada’s Berlin-Icthyosaur State Park contains the largest known Shonisaurus popularis ichthyosaur fossils. These
                    extinct marine reptiles, which ranged in size from 2 feet to over 50 feet long, swam in the ocean that covered central
                    Nevada 225 million years ago during the Triassic Period.
