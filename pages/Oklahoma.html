        <p>
            The land that today makes up Oklahoma was added to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
            Throughout the 19th century, the U.S. government relocated Indian tribes from the southeastern United States to the
            area, and by 1900, over 30 Indian tribes had been moved to what was originally called the Indian Territories.
            
            At the same time, ranchers in Texas began to move into the area in search of new pasture lands, and the government
            eventually opened the land to settlement, creating “land runs” in which settlers were allowed to cross the border at a
            particular hour to claim homesteads. Settlers who broke the law and crossed the border sooner than allowed were called
            “sooners,” which eventually became the state’s nickname. Oklahoma became the 46th state in 1907, following several acts
            that incorporated more and more Indian tribal land into U.S. territory.
            
            After its inclusion in the union, Oklahoma became a center for oil production, with much of the state’s early growth
            coming from that industry. During the 1930s, Oklahoma suffered from droughts and high winds, destroying many farms and
            creating the infamous dust bowl of the Great Depression era.

                    In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which forced the Eastern Woodlands Indian tribes off of their homelands
                    and into “Indian Territory,” which is now the state of Oklahoma. By 1840, nearly 100,000 Indians had been evicted and
                    close to 15,000 had died of disease, exposure to elements or malnutrition along the journey, which became known as the
                    “Trail of Tears.”

                <li>
                    In 1905, representatives from the Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, Choctaw and Chickasaw nations—known as the Five Civilized
                    Tribes—submitted a constitution for a separate Indian state to be called Sequoyah. Although a large majority of voters
                    supported the petition in the November election, Congress refused to consider the request for statehood. On November 16,
                    1907, Indian and Oklahoma territories were combined to form the state of Oklahoma.

                    Oklahoma’s state capitol building is the only capital with an oil well directly underneath it. In 1941, the “Petunia
                    Number One” well was slant drilled through a flowerbed to reach the oil pool, which produced approximately 1.5 million
                    bbl. over the course of 43 years.
