            Following exploration by the Spanish and French, in the 17th and 18th centuries, Oregon was mapped by the Lewis and
            Clark expedition in their search for the Northwest Passage. Starting in the 1830s, many groups of pioneers traveled to
            the state on the famous Oregon Trail, and the U.S. began joint settlement of the area with the United Kingdom. In 1846,
            the border between U.S. and British territory was formally established at the 49th parallel – the part of the territory
            that was given to Britain would ultimately become part of Canada. Oregon was officially admitted to the union as a state
            on February 14th, 1859. Today, Portland, Oregon’s largest city, is considered one of the top cities in the nation in
            terms of quality of life, and the state is also known as one of the nation’s top producers of wine, boasting over 300
            wineries.

                <li>Oregon’s Crater Lake, formed in the remnant of an ancient volcano, is the deepest lake in the United States.</li>
                <li>Oregon grows 99 percent of all hazelnuts produced in the United States. It is also the country’s leading producer of
                Christmas trees, with an output of more than 4.9 million trees in 2009.
                </li>
                <li>Beginning in 1843, roughly 12,000 emigrants made the 2,000-mile trek from Independence, Missouri, to the Oregon
                Territory. Heavily traveled until 1884, the Oregon Trail was the most used of all routes in the westward expansion of
                the United States.
                </li>
                <li>In November of 1986, the 80-mile-long Columbia River Gorge, which traverses the border between Oregon and Washington,
                was designated the country’s first National Scenic Area. Since the mixture of cool marine air on the western side of the
                Cascades and the drier air from the inland basin creates a natural wind tunnel, the gorge is considered to be one of the
                best places in the world for windsurfing.
