            Part of the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, Arkansas became a separate territory in 1819 and achieved statehood
            in 1836. A slave state, Arkansas became the ninth state to secede from the union and join the Confederate States of
            America. Today Arkansas ranks 27th among the 50 states in the area, but, except for Louisiana and Hawaii, it is the
            smallest state west of the Mississippi River. Its neighbors are Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the
            east, Louisiana to the south, Texas to the southwest and Oklahoma to the west. The name Arkansas was used by the early
            French explorers to refer to the Quapaw people—a prominent indigenous group in the area—and to the river along which
            they settled. The term was likely a corruption of akansea, the word applied to the Quapaw by another local indigenous
            community, the Illinois. Little Rock, the state capital, is located in the central part of the state. In 1957, Little
            Rock Central High School became the focus of national attention when federal troops were deployed to the campus to
            enforce integration.

                    Arkansas is home to a wide array of natural resources including petroleum, natural gas, bromine and silica stone.
                    Throughout the 20th century, the state was responsible for providing roughly 90 percent of all domestic Bauxite, from
                    which aluminum is made.

                    Although it was not officially designated a national park until 1921, the territory now known as Hot Springs National
                    Park was originally set aside by Congress as a U.S. government reservation in 1832—40 years before Yellowstone National
                    Park was established as the “first” national park. With an average temperature of 143 degrees Fahrenheit, the hot
                    springs have been used for centuries as therapeutic baths.

                    Following the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which outlawed segregation in public
                    education, Little Rock’s Central High School became a battleground in the fight for civil rights when the Arkansas
                    National Guard denied nine African-American students entry in 1957. Weeks later, on September 25th, the students
                    attended their first full day of school under federal troop escort ordered by President Dwight Eisenhower.

                    Arkansas is the nation’s leading producer of rice and poultry and grows nearly every crop produced in the United States
                    with the exception of citrus fruits
