            Rhode Island, measuring only about 48 miles long and 37 miles wide, is the smallest of the U.S. states. Despite its
            small area, Rhode Island, known as the “Ocean State,” boasts over 400 miles of coastline. Rhode Island was founded by
            Roger Williams in 1636, who had been banished from the Massachusetts colony for his advocacy of religious tolerance and
            the separation of church and state.
            
            During the colonial period, Newport was a major hub for shipping and trade, and in the 19th century, Rhode Island was at
            the forefront of the Industrial Revolution and the establishment of power-driven textile mills. Rhode Island hosted the
            first National Lawn Tennis Championship in 1899, and is home to the Tennis Hall of Fame. Famous Rhode Islanders include
            novelists Cormac MacCarthy and Jhumpa Lahiri, actor James Woods, television personality Meredith Vieira and Civil War
            U.S. Army officer Ambrose Burnside.

                    Preferring the Articles of Confederation, Rhode Island refused to participate in creating the U.S. Constitution and was
