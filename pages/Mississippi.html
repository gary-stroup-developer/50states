            Mississippi joined the Union as the 20th state in 1817 and gets its name from the Mississippi River, which forms its
            western border. Early inhabitants of the area that became Mississippi included the Choctaw, Natchez and Chickasaw.
            Spanish explorers arrived in the region in 1540 but it was the French who established the first permanent settlement in
            present-day Mississippi in 1699. During the first half of the 19th century, Mississippi was the top cotton producer in
            the United States, and owners of large plantations depended on the labor of black slaves. Mississippi seceded from the
            Union in 1861 and suffered greatly during the American Civil War. Despite the abolition of slavery, racial
            discrimination endured in Mississippi, and the state was a battleground of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th
            century. In the early 21st century, Mississippi ranked among America’s poorest states

                    Oliver Pollock, an Irish merchant in Spanish-controlled New Orleans who used his fortune to help finance the American
                    Revolution, is credited with creating the dollar sign in 1778. He is buried in Pinckneyville, where he lived with his
                    son-in-law prior to his death on December 17, 1823.

                    The Blues musical form originated in the Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Rooted in the songs sung by slaves
                    working in the fields and African spirituals, the Blues offered an escape from oppression and a means of expression for
                    many African Americans.

                    The flight school at Columbus Air Force Base trained more than 8,000 students during World War II to become flying

                    Mississippi produces some 60 percent of America’s farm-raised catfish. Commercial catfish production began in the state
                    in the mid-1960s. The Mississippi Delta city of Belzoni, billed as the Catfish Capital of the World, has a catfish
                    museum and hosts an annual catfish festival.
