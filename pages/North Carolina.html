            One of the original 13 colonies, North Carolina was the first state to instruct its delegates to vote for independence
            from the British crown during the Continental Congress. Following the Revolutionary War, North Carolina developed an
            extensive slave plantation system and became a major exporter of cotton and tobacco, although the slave population
            remained relatively small compared to that of other southern states. In 1861, North Carolina became one of 11 states to
            secede from the United States, beginning the American Civil War. Despite no major battles being fought in the state,
            North Carolina sent more recruits to fight for the Confederacy than any other rebel state. In 1903, the state became the
            site of the first manned self-propelled airplane flight when the Wright brothers took off from a cliff near Kitty Hawk.

                    In one of the nation’s most intriguing mysteries, a group of around 150 colonists from Plymouth, England, who had landed
                    on Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in July 1587 vanished without a trace, except for the word “Croatoan”
                    scratched on a post that had enclosed the settlement. Although there have been several hypotheses as to what occurred,
                    historians and archaeologists have been unable to find evidence to support any of them.

                    The first child born in America of English descent was a girl named Virginia Dare. Born on August 18, 1587, Virginia was
                    one of the members of the “Lost Colony,” discovered missing on what would have been her 3rd birthday by her grandfather
                    John White, who had originally led the colonial expedition to Roanoke Island but later returned to England for supplies.

                    Orville and Wilbur Wright’s first powered airplane flight on December 17, 1903, covered only 120 feet and lasted only 12
                    seconds.

                    During World War II, approximately 10,000 enemy soldiers were contained within 18 prisoners of war camps throughout the
                    state of North Carolina
