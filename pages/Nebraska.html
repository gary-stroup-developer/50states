            Nebraska, which was admitted to the union as the 37th state on March 1, 1867, two years after the end of the American
            Civil War, contains some of the nation’s best ranchland and farmland. Prior to its statehood, the Nebraska Territory had
            been sparsely settled but saw growth during the California Gold Rush in 1848, with a larger wave of settlers arriving as
            homesteaders in the 1860s. Although the territorial capital of Nebraska was Omaha when it achieved statehood the seat of
            government was moved to Lancaster, which was later renamed Lincoln after President Abraham Lincoln, who had recently
            been assassinated. Nebraska is bounded by South Dakota to the north, Kansas and Colorado to the South, Wyoming to the
            West and Iowa and Missouri to the East.

                    The world’s largest exhibited mammoth skeleton was found on a farm in Lincoln County in 1922. Originating from the Late
                    Pleistocene Era, “Archie” is on display at the University of Nebraska State Museum.

                    Nebraska is the only state with a nonpartisan, unicameral legislature. Promoted by Senator George Norris for its
                    efficiency, cost-effectiveness and ability to eliminate secretive conference committee meetings common in bicameral
                    legislatures, Nebraska has been governed by a single-house legislature since 1937.

                    Bailey Yard in North Platte is the world’s largest train yard, situated on 2,850 acres of land spanning eight miles. It
                    manages as many as 10,000 rail cars each day and can repair up to 20 cars per hour in its immense locomotive repair
                    shop.

                    The Ogallala Aquifer, which lies beneath 174,000 square miles of eight states extending from South Dakota down to
                    western Texas, provides almost all of the water for residential, industrial and agricultural use in the High Plains
                    region. Two-thirds of the Ogallala’s total supply comes from Nebraska.
