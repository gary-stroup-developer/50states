            Minnesota became the 32nd state of the union on May 11, 1858. A small extension of the northern boundary makes it the
            most northerly of the 48 conterminous U.S. states. (This peculiar protrusion is the result of a boundary agreement with
            Great Britain before the area had been carefully surveyed.) Minnesota is bounded by the Canadian provinces of Manitoba
            and Ontario to the north, by Lake Superior and Wisconsin to the east, by Iowa to the south and South Dakota and North
            Dakota to the west. Minnesota is the home of the Mall of America, which holds more than 400 stores and attracts nearly
            40 million people a year.

                    On December 26, 1862, 38 of 303 convicted Dakota Indians were hanged in Mankato in the largest mass execution in
                    American history. Frustrated by the U.S. government’s failure to make treaty payments on time and supply their families
                    with food as promised, a group of warriors killed several settlers, igniting an armed conflict that lasted four months.
                    Although President Abraham Lincoln commuted the death sentences of 264 convicted Dakota, Congress passed a law expelling
                    all Dakota bands from Minnesota a few months later.

                    The first successful open-heart surgery was performed on a 5-year-old girl on September 2, 1952, by Dr. Floyd John Lewis
                    and Dr. Clarence Walton Lillehei at the University of Minnesota. With her body temperature reduced to 81 degrees
                    Fahrenheit, the girl was able to survive for 10 minutes while the doctors repaired a congenital hole in her heart.

                    Bloomington’s Mall of America, which opened in 1992, is the most visited shopping mall in the United States with roughly
                    40 million visitors each year. The megastructure encompasses 4.2 million square feet—enough space to fit 32 Boeing 747s
                    inside.

                    Minnesota’s nickname is the “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” A more precise moniker would be the “Land of 11,842 Lakes.”
