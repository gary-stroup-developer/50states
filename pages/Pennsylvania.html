        <p>
            One of the original 13 colonies, Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn as a haven for his fellow Quakers.
            Pennsylvania’s capital, Philadelphia, was the site of the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and 1775, the
            latter of which produced the Declaration of Independence, sparking the American Revolution.
            
            After the war, Pennsylvania became the second state, after Delaware, to ratify the U.S. Constitution. In the American
            Civil War (1861-1865), Pennsylvania was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg in which Union General George Meade
            defeated Confederate General Robert E. Lee, bringing an end to the Confederacy’s Northern invasion, as well as Lincoln’s
            famous Gettysburg Address.
            
            Tourists are drawn to Pennsylvania by its monuments to America’s revolutionary history, including Independence Hall and
            the Liberty Bell. Famous Pennsylvanians include patriot and inventor Benjamin Franklin, frontiersman Daniel Boone,
            painter Mary Cassatt and inventor Robert Fulton.

                    William Penn initially requested his land grant be named “Sylvania,” from the Latin for “woods.” Charles II instead
                    named it “Pennsylvania,” after Penn’s father, causing Penn to worry that settlers would believe he named it after
                    himself.

                    The worst nuclear accident in United States history occurred on March 28, 1979, on Three Mile Island near Harrisburg.
                    Caused by a series of system malfunctions and human errors, the plant’s nuclear reactor core partially melted, and
                    thousands of residents were evacuated or fled the area, fearing exposure to radiation.

                    In 1903, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates competed against each other in the first official World Series of
                    Major League Baseball at Exposition Park in Pittsburgh. In the best-of-nine series, Boston won five games to three.

                    On September 18, 1777, fearing that the approaching British army would seize and melt the Liberty Bell for ammunition,
                    200 cavalrymen transported the iconic symbol of freedom by caravan from the Philadelphia State House to the basement of
                    the Zion Reformed Church in Allentown, where it remained until the British finally left in June of 1778
