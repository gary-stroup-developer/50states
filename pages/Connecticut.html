        <p>
            One of the original 13 colonies and one of the six New England states, Connecticut is located in the northeastern corner
            of the country. Initially an agricultural community, by the mid-19th century textile and machine manufacturing had
            become the dominant industries. The home of Eli Whitney and Samuel Colt, Connecticut was a leading manufacturer of guns
            and other arms.
            
            Today Connecticut lies in the midst of the great urban-industrial complex along the Atlantic coast, bordering
            Massachusetts to the north, Rhode Island to the east, Long Island Sound to the south and New York to the west. Hartford,
            in the north-central part of the state, is the capital. The state is roughly rectangular in shape, with a panhandle
            extending to the southwest on the New York border. In area, it is the third smallest U.S. state, but it ranks among the
            most densely populated. The state’s greatest east-west length is about 110 miles, and its maximum north-south extent is
            about 70 miles.
            
            Connecticut takes its name from an Algonquian word meaning “land on the long tidal river.” “Nutmeg State,” “Constitution
            State” and “Land of Steady Habits” are all nicknames that have been applied to Connecticut.

                    The Fundamental Orders was the first constitution to be adopted by the American colonies in 1639. It established the
                    structure and boundaries of the newly formed government and ensured the rights of free men to elect their public
                    officials—principles that were later embraced within the U.S. Constitution.

                    During a candle-lit dispute that occurred when Sir Edmund Andros attempted to seize Connecticut’s Royal Charter by order
                    of King James II in 1687, the lights went out and the charter was whisked away to safety amid the chaos. Captain Joseph
                    Wadsworth hid the charter inside a grand white oak tree, which became a symbol of freedom and, later, the official state
                    tree.

                    Benedict Arnold, whose name has become synonymous with the word “traitor” after he conspired with the British to turn
                    over the post at West Point in exchange for money and a command in the British Army, was born in Norwich, Connecticut.
                    In 1781, he led British troops in the Battle of Groton Heights, which devastated New London, Connecticut.

                    Connecticut and Rhode Island were the only two states that failed to ratify the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the
                    manufacture, sale or transportation of alcohol.
