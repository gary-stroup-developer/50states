        <p>
            Granted statehood in 1889, Washington was named in honor of George Washington; it is the only U.S. state named after a
            president. The state’s coastal location and excellent harbors have contributed to its role as a leader in trade with
            Alaska, Canada and countries of the Pacific Rim. The majestic Mount Rainier soars above Seattle and is the highest peak
            in the continental United States. Another Washington landmark, Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, the deadliest and most
            economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. The Evergreen State is the nation’s leading producer of apples
            and is the home of the coffee chain Starbucks. Famous Washingtonians include musician Jimi Hendrix, entertainer Bing
            Crosby and computer pioneer Bill Gates.

                <li>In 1836, Marcus and Narcissa Whitman established a mission at Waiilatpu on the Walla Walla River to bring Christianity
                to the Cayuse Indians. When an increasing number of colonists migrated to the area and an epidemic of measles spared the
                lives of white children but killed almost all Cayuse offspring, Chief Tiloukaikt and several members of his tribe became
                infuriated, and, on November 29, 1847, killed the Whitmans along with 12 other settlers. The Whitman Massacre, as it
                became known, resulted in the Cayuse War and, ultimately, the dissolution of the Cayuse tribe.
