        <p>
            The land that today makes up North Dakota became U.S.territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The region was
            originally part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories, until, along with South Dakota, it was organized into the
            Dakota Territory in 1861. The state was very sparsely populated until the arrival of the railroads in the late 1800s,
            and finally became a state in 1889. During the run-up to statehood, there was an intense rivalry between North and South
            Dakota over which state would be admitted to the union first. When the time came for their formal admission, President
            Benjamin Harrison selected at random which bill to sign first and did not record the order in which the bills were
            signed, though North Dakota is traditionally listed first. The state is renowned for its scenic “badlands,” which are
            part of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park.

                    Originally conceived of in 1928 by Dr. Henry Moore of Ontario, Canada, the International Peace Garden was intended to
                    establish a memorial to perpetual peace between Canada and the United States. Encompassing 2,339 acres within North
                    Dakota and the Canadian province of Manitoba, the park attracted 50,000 visitors to its grand opening and dedication on
                    July 14, 1932.

                    Attempts to drop the word “North” and rename the state “Dakota” were defeated by the legislature in both 1947 and 1989.

                    Theodore Roosevelt, who once credited his time spent in the North Dakota Badlands as critical to becoming the 26th
                    president of the United States, fostered a legacy of resource conservation that has been memorialized by the creation of
                    the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Comprised of three distinct units in western North Dakota, the park covers more
                    than 70,000 acres.

                    The geographical center of North America—marked by a 21-foot monument constructed out of stones—lies in the town of
                    Rugby, North Dakota.
