            Kentucky was granted statehood in 1792, becoming the first U.S. state west of the Appalachian Mountains. Frontiersman
            Daniel Boone was one of Kentucky’s most prominent explorers and many immigrants followed the trail he blazed through the
            Cumberland Gap, known as the Wilderness Road.
            
            The state remained officially neutral during the Civil War and its population was deeply divided. Soldiers from Kentucky
            served in both the Union and Confederate armies. Known primarily as an agricultural area into the 20th century, Kentucky
            is also a major U.S. coal producer and site of the U.S.military bases Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. It is also known as
            the home of the legendary Kentucky Derby horse race and bluegrass music, pioneered by Kentucky native Bill Monroe.

                    Despite the fact that there were no battles fought within the state, more than half of all Americans killed in action
                    during the War of 1812 were from Kentucky.

                    In late August of 1888, nine members of the Hatfield family were tried and convicted at the Pike County Courthouse in
                    Kentucky for a raid on Randall McCoy’s home, in which his son and daughter were killed, his wife was beaten unconscious
                    and his home was burned to the ground. The long-running feud between the Hatfields of West Virginia and the McCoys of
                    Kentucky claimed a dozen members of the two clans. In 2003, the families signed a formal truce, putting an official end
                    to the hostilitie

                    The “Happy Birthday to You” melody was the creation of sisters Mildred and Patty Hill in 1893. While working at
                    Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School, the duo created a song for teachers to sing to students entitled “Good
                    Morning to All.” In 1924, Robert Coleman first published the “Happy Birthday to You” lyrics along with the tune. It is
                    now one of the most popular songs in the English language.
