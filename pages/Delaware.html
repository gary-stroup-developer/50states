            The first of the original 13 states to ratify the federal Constitution, Delaware occupies a small niche in the
            Boston–Washington, D.C., urban corridor along the Middle Atlantic seaboard. It is the second smallest state in the
            country and one of the most densely populated. The state is organized into three counties—from north to south, New
            Castle, Kent and Sussex—all established by 1682. Its population, like its industry, is concentrated in the north, around
            Wilmington, where the major coastal highways and railways pass through from Pennsylvania and New Jersey on the north and
            east into Maryland on the south and west. The rest of the state comprises the northeastern corner of the Delmarva
            Peninsula, which Delaware shares with Maryland and Virginia (hence its name). Most state government operations are
            located in Dover, the capital.

                    The first European colony in the Delaware Valley was established by Swedish settlers in 1638. Between 1698 and 1699, the
                    descendants of these early colonists constructed Old Swedes Church (also known as Holy Trinity Church), which is one of
                    the oldest houses of worship in America still in use.

                    According to legend, Delaware was nicknamed “The Diamond State” because Thomas Jefferson referred to it as a “jewel
                    among the states” due to its prime location on the Eastern Seaboard.

                    After the onset of World War II, several concrete observation towers ranging between 39 and 75 feet tall were
                    constructed along Delaware’s coast to protect the bay and coastal towns from German warships. Eleven towers remain in
                    Delaware and two remain in Cape May, NJ.

                    Delaware Bay is home to more horseshoe crabs than anywhere else in the world. Mostly unchanged for the past 300 million
                    years, these “living fossils” were collected by Native American Indians for food and used as fertilizer—a practice that
                    was passed along to early colonial settlers and continued until the 1960s. Currently used in biomedical research,
                    horseshoe crabs have played an invaluable role in studying the human eye and detecting bacteria in drugs.
