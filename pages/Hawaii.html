            Hawaii (Hawaiian: Hawai‘i) is a group of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands lie 2,397 miles from
            San Francisco, California, to the east and 5,293 miles from Manila, in the Philippines, to the west. The capital is
            Honolulu, located on the island of Oahu. The islands were annexed by the United States in 1900, and as a U.S. territory
            saw population expansion and the establishment of a plantation system for growing sugar cane and pineapples. On the
            morning of December 7, 1941, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor near
            Honolulu. The surprise attack destroyed nearly 20 vessels, killed more than 2,000 American soldiers and propelled the
            United States into World War II. Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state on August 21, 1959.

                    Mount Waialeale on Kauai is one of the wettest places on earth. It receives an average of around 460 inches of rain each
                    year.

                    With rich volcanic soil and ideal farming conditions, Hawaii is the only U.S. state that grows coffee. In 2006, Kona
                    coffee was named by Forbes.com as one of the world’s top 10 most expensive brews at around $34 per pound.

                    Hawaii’s population center is the most isolated on Earth—more than 2,300 miles from the United States, 3,850 miles from
                    Japan, 4,900 miles from China and 5,280 miles from the Philippines.

                    Hawaii’s Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain on earth, with a height of over 30,000 feet from its base—on the floor of the
                    Pacific Ocean—to its peak.
