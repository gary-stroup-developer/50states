            New Hampshire, one of the original 13 colonies, was the first state to have its own state constitution. Its spirit of
            independence is epitomized in the state motto–“Live Free or Die.” New Hampshire was the 9th state to ratify the U.S.
            Constitution–the final state needed to put the document into effect. It plays an important role in national elections,
            as it is the first state to holdnational primaries, and its primary results are thought to influence those in the rest
            of the nation, giving rise to the saying “As New Hampshire goes, so goes the nation.” It is the site of the White
            Mountains and the famed Mount Washington, one of the windiest places in the nation.

                    The “Old Man in the Mountain,” depicted on the New Hampshire state quarter, was a rock formation in Franconia Notch made
                    up of five distinct granite ledges that lined up perfectly into the shape of a man’s profile. Formed by a series of
                    geologic events that occurred over millions of years, the profile extended nearly 40 feet from forehead to chin. On May
                    3, 2003, the Old Man in the Mountain collapsed from its perch 1,200 feet above Profile Lake.

                    The Scotch-Irish immigrants who settled in Nutfield in April 1719 planted the first potato crops in North America. The
                    settlement, which was later renamed Londonderry, is now the town of Derry.

                    On December 13, 1774, four months before his famous “midnight ride” to Lexington, Massachusetts, Paul Revere embarked on
                    a 55-mile ride from Boston to Portsmouth to warn of Fort William and Mary’s imminent seizure from British troops. One of
                    the first acts of rebellion leading up to the revolution, a group of nearly 400 townspeople responded by raiding the
                    garrison’s gunpowder to prevent the takeover, lowering the fort’s British flag upon their return to Portsmouth.

                    New Hampshire is one of only nine states that does not require its residents to pay state income tax.
