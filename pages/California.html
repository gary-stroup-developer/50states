                The first Spanish missionaries arrived in California in the 1700s, but California didn’t become a U.S. territory until
                1847, as part of the treaty ending the Mexican-American War. Shortly thereafter, the discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill
                in 1848 inspired a wave of settlers to head to the west coast in search of fortune. In 1850 California became the 31st
                state, and is now the third-largest state behind Alaska and Texas. With millions of acres of farmland, California leads
                the U.S. in agricultural production. The state is also home to famous cultural institutions and national parks including
                Hollywood, Disneyland, Yosemite National Park, Alcatraz, Angel Island and the Golden Gate Bridge.

                    <li>Following James Marshall’s discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma in 1848, California’s population leaped from
                    14,000 to 250,000 in only four years. Between 1850 and 1859, miners extracted 28,280,711 fine ounces of gold.</li>
                    <li>California grows more than 3.3 million tons of winegrapes on over 540,000 acres each year and produces roughly 90
                    percent of all U.S. wine</li>
                    <li>With a trunk slightly greater than 102 feet in circumference, the General Sherman in Sequoia National Park is the
                    largest living tree (by volume) in the world. It is estimated to be somewhere between 1,800 to 2,700 years old.</li>
                    <li>Considered to be the hottest, driest place in the United States, Death Valley often reaches temperatures greater than
                    120 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer and averages only around two inches of rain each year.</li>
