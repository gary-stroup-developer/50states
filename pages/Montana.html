            Montana is the fourth largest U.S. state by area, behind Alaska, Texas and California, but with an average of just six
            people per square mile, it is one of the country’s least densely populated states. Although the name Montana is derived
            from the Spanish montaña (“mountain” or “mountainous region”), it has an average elevation of only 3,400 feet, the
            lowest among the Rocky Mountain states. Montana is home to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, which
            memorializes the historic 1876 battle between the Sioux tribe and U.S. Army, often referred to as “Custer’s Last Stand.”
            Yellowstone National Park, located in southern Montana and northern Wyoming, was the first national park established in
            the United States

                    Carved by glaciers more than 10,000 years ago, Flathead Lake is the largest freshwater lake between the Mississippi
                    River and the Pacific Ocean. It is 28 miles long, between 5 and 15 miles wide and encompasses nearly 200 square miles.

                    The coldest temperature in the 48 contiguous states ever recorded was -70 degrees Fahrenheit in Rogers Pass on January
                    20, 1954. In January of 1972, Loma, Montana, broke the national record for the greatest temperature change within a
                    24-hour period by recording a 103-degree climb from -54 degrees Fahrenheit to 49 degrees Fahrenheit.

                    Eleven tribal nations live on seven Indian reservations in Montana. A twelfth tribe, the Little Shell Band of Chippewa,
                    lives within the state without its own land.

                    Montana’s large gold and silver mines gave rise to its nickname, the Treasure State, and its state motto, “Oro y Plata”
                    (Spanish for “Gold and Silver”)
