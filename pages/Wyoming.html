            Wyoming became the 44th state to join the union in 1890. Wyoming was the first U.S. state to allow women to vote–an
            achievement that represented one of the early victories of the American women’s suffrage movement. Today, although it is
            the 10th largest state by area, Wyoming has the smallest population of all the states, with just over 550,000 residents.
            The state is home to most of Yellowstone National Park, one of the most popular national parks in the country. Millions
            of tourists visit Wyoming every year to see the geyser Old Faithful and the Grand Prismatic Spring, the largest hot
            spring in the country, as well as a variety of wildlife including moose, elk, bighorn sheep, wolves, coyotes, eagles,
            black bears and grizzly bears.
