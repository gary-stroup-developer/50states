            Vermont was initially settled in the early 18th century by both the British and French, and conflicts between the two
            nations continued until the French defeat in the French and Indian War, after which the land was ceded to England.
            During the American Revolution, Vermont declared independence separately from the original 13 colonies, although the
            Continental Congress refused to recognize it. Vermont was finally admitted to the union as the 14th state in 1790, after
            14 years as an independent republic. The name of the state is derived from”montagne verte,” French for green mountain,
            giving rise to the state’s “Green Mountain State” nickname. Today, Vermont’s mountains are a popular destination for
            skiers and snowboarders. It is the country’s leading producer of maple syrup and is the home of the popular Ben &
            Jerry’s ice cream.

                    On October 5, 1798, congressman Matthew Lyon was indicted under the Sedition Act for criticizing President John Adams in
                    a letter he had written to Spooner’s Vermont Journal. Fined $1,000 and sentenced to four months in jail, Lyon was
                    re-elected to Congress while incarcerated.

                    One of the first ski lifts in the U.S. was developed on a farm in Woodstock in 1934. Designed by Wallace “Bunny” Bertram
                    and powered by an antique Model-T Ford engine, the tow pulled people up a hill while holding onto a moving rope.

                    The first monthly Social Security benefit check was issued to Ludlow, Vermont, resident Ida May Fuller on January 31,
                    1940. After retiring from her job as a legal secretary, Fuller received her first check in the amount of $22.54—$2.21
                    less than the total taxes withdrawn from her salary during the three years that she worked under the Social Security
                    program

                    Vermont became the first state to legally recognize civil unions between partners of the same sex in April 2000. Nine
                    years later, the state legislature granted full marriage rights to same-sex couples.
