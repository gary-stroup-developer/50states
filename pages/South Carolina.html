        <p>
            Settled by the English in 1670, South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Its
            early economy was largely agricultural, benefitting from the area’s fertile soil. Plantation farmers relied on the slave
            trade for cheap labor to maximize profits.
            
            By 1730, people of African descent made up two-thirds of the colony’s population. South Carolina became the first state
            to secede from the Union in 1861 and was the site of the first shots of the Civil War–the shelling of the federally held
            Fort Sumter by Confederate troops on April 12, 1861.
            
            Today, South Carolina's coastline near Myrtle Beach has developed into one of the premier resort destinations on the
            East Coast and has over 100 golf courses. Famous South Carolinians include musicians James Brown, Chubby Checker and
            Dizzy Gillespie, novelist Pat Conroy, boxer Joe Frazier, tennis champion Althea Gibson, politician Jesse Jackson and
            long-serving U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond.

                    In 2000, the Confederate flag was removed from the dome on top of the State House and placed on the grounds near the
                    Confederate Soldier Monument in response to an NAACP boycott of the state and protests over its legacy. More than 10
                    years later, the flag’s location continues to be the subject of ongoing controversy.

                    The only commercial tea plantation in the contiguous 48 states is on Wadmalaw Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.

                    After capturing Columbia on February 17, 1865, Union soldiers under General William Tecumseh Sherman burned and
                    destroyed more than two-thirds of the city. Due to scarce funding following the war, the new State House was not rebuilt
                    until 1903.

                    Charleston welcomed a shipment of golf balls and clubs from Scotland as early as 1743. On September 29, 1786, the South
                    Carolina Golf Club was formed and, within the same year, America’s first golf course was established on Harleston Green.
                    In 2011, there were more than 350 golf courses within the state of South Carolina.
