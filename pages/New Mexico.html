            Colonized by Spain, the land that is now New Mexico became U.S. territory as part of the Gadsen Purchase in 1853, though
            New Mexico did not become a U.S. state until 1912. During World War II, New Mexico was the site of the top-secret
            Manhattan Project, in which top U.S. scientists raced to create the first atomic bomb, which was tested at the Trinity
            Bombsite, near Alamagordo, on July 16, 1945. In 1947, Roswell, New Mexico, became a topic of speculation about
            extraterrestrial life when a local farmer discovered unidentified debris on his property, which some believed was the
            remains of a crashed alien spacecraft. Visitors to New Mexico frequent attractions like the Very Large Array telescope
            in Socorro and the historic city of Santa Fe, which artist Georgia O’Keeffe famously called home.

                    White Sands National Park contains the largest gypsum dune field in the world. The result of water evaporating from
                    transitory lakes with high mineral content, gypsum deposits are windswept into picturesque white sand dunes spanning 275
                    square miles.

                    On July 16, 1945, the world’s first atomic bomb was tested at the Trinity Site in central New Mexico. The bomb was the
                    creation of the Manhattan Project, which had been commissioned to build a nuclear weapon in 1942 after receiving
                    intelligence that Germany was developing an atomic bomb of its own. Residents felt the 19-kiloton explosion as far as
                    160 miles away.

                    The Spanish language spoken by close to a quarter of a million people throughout New Mexico and southern Colorado is an
                    ancient dialect that is largely Castilian in origin.
