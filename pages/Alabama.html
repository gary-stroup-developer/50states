            Alabama, which joined the union as the 22nd state in 1819, is located in the southern United States and nicknamed the
            “Heart of Dixie.” The region that became Alabama was occupied by aboriginals as early as some 10,000 years ago.
            Europeans reached the area in the 16th century. During the first half of the 19th century, cotton and slave labor were
            central to Alabama’s economy. The state played a key role in the American Civil War; its capital, Montgomery, was the
            Confederacy’s first capital. Following the war, segregation of blacks and whites prevailed throughout much of the South.
            In the mid-20th century, Alabama was at the center of the American Civil Rights Movement and home to such pivotal events
            as the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In the early 21st century, the state’s economy was fueled in part by jobs in aerospace,
            agriculture, auto production and the service sector.

                    In 1919, the city of Enterprise erected a monument to the boll weevil in recognition of the destructive insect’s role in
                    saving the county’s economy by encouraging farmers to grow more lucrative crops such as peanuts instead of traditional
                    cotton.

                    The DeSoto Caverns near the city of Birmingham, which contain a 2,000-year-old Native American burial site, served as a
                    clandestine speakeasy with dancing and gambling during Prohibition.

                    The Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American flying unit in the U.S. military, were trained in Alabama. Their
                    accomplished combat record, including the accumulation of more than 850 medals, was an important factor in President
                    Truman’s decision to desegregate armed forces in 1948.

                    In 1965, five months before President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act prohibiting discriminatory voting practices,
                    thousands of non-violent protesters joined a 54-mile Selma to Montgomery march to bring attention to the injustice
                    African Americans faced when attempting to register to vote.
