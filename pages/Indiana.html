            Indiana sits, as its motto claims, at “the crossroads of America.” It borders Lake Michigan and the state of Michigan to
            the north, Ohio to the east, Kentucky to the south, and Illinois to the west, making it an integral part of the American
            Midwest. Except for Hawaii, Indiana is the smallest state west of the Appalachian Mountains. After the American
            Revolution, the lands of Indiana were open to U.S. settlers. The influx of white immigrants brought increased war with
            the Native American tribes. The conflicts continued until the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, which was won by General, and
            future president, William Henry Harrison. With a name that is generally thought to mean “land of the Indians,” Indiana
            was admitted on Dec. 11, 1816, as the 19th state of the union. Its capital has been in Indianapolis since 1825.

                    Many families throughout the state of Indiana provided shelter for runaway slaves both before and during the Civil War.
                    In particular, the farming community of Newport (now Fountain City) became known as the “Grand Central Station of the
                    Underground Railroad” due to Levi and Catherine Coffin’s role in helping more than 2,000 runaway slaves make their way
                    north to freedom.

                    Bedford, Indiana, is known as the “Limestone Capital of the World.” Admired for its light color and ease of cutting,
                    Indiana limestone was used in the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City, the Pentagon and National
                    Cathedral in Washington, D.C., as well as several state capitols.

                    Although authorities claimed the county jail in Crown Point was “escape-proof,” notorious bank robber John Dillinger
                    successfully broke free from his cell on March 3, 1934, by threatening guards with a fake pistol carved from wood. Using
                    the sheriff’s car to make his getaway, Dillinger crossed the Indiana-Illinois border, setting off a federal manhunt that
                    led to his death by FBI agents on July 22nd.

                    In August of 1987, more than 4,000 athletes from 38 nations met in Indianapolis for the Pan American Games after both
                    Chile and Ecuador reneged as host due to financial reasons.
