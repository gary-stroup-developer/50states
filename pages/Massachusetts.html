            One of the original 13 colonies and one of the six New England states, Massachusetts (officially called a commonwealth)
            is known for being the landing place of the Mayflower and the Pilgrims. English explorer and colonist John Smith named
            the state for the Massachuset tribe. Boston, the state capital, was a hotbed of activity, including the Boston Massacre
            and the Boston Tea Party, during the American Revolution. In addition to its revolutionary spirit, the state is known
            for sparking the American Industrial Revolution with the growth of textile mills in Lowell, and for its large
            Irish-American population.

                    Established in Cambridge in 1636 by vote of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Harvard University was the first institution
                    of higher education in the United States.

                    Nineteen people were hanged at Gallows Hill in 1692 for worshipping the devil and practicing witchcraft, and close to
                    200 others were similarly accused. In 1711, after judge Samuel Sewall and others involved in the Salem witch trials had
                    admitted wrongdoing, the colony restored the good names of all accused and granted restitution to their heirs.

                    Massachusetts observes a legal holiday called Patriots’ Day on the third Monday of April each year, commemorating the
                    first battles of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.

                    Following the American Revolutionary War, many people struggled to support their families under the heavy tax burdens
                    levied to pay off war debt. Faced with losing their property, a group of insurgents led by Daniel Shays—a farmer and
                    veteran of the war—forced the closure of several debtors’ courts and attempted to occupy a federal arsenal in
                    Springfield on January 25, 1787. Although repelled, Shays’ Rebellion highlighted the need for a stronger national
                    government and influenced the creation of the U.S. Constitution.
