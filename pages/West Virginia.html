        <p>
            When the state of Virginia voted to secede from the United States during the Civil War (1861-65), the people of the
            rugged and mountainous western region of the state opposed the decision and organized to form their own state, West
            Virginia, in support of the Union. Congress granted statehood to West Virginia on June 20, 1863. The West Virginia town
            of Harpers Ferry was the site of John Brown’s ill-fated 1859 raid on the federal armory there. Although Brown’s plan to
            arm a large-scale revolt of enslaved people with weapons from the armory ultimately failed. Brown was hanged, the raid
            did succeed in inflaming white Southern fears of rebellions and increased the mounting tension between North and South
            prior to the Civil War.
            
            Today, West Virginia is a major coal-producing state, supplying 15 percent of the nation’s coal. The New River Gorge
            Bridge near Fayetteville is the longest steel arch bridge in the world. Every October, the town hosts a Bridge Day
            celebration when the road is closed to traffic and individuals are allowed to parachute and bungee jump off the bridge;
            the event attracts close to 100,000 participants and spectators each year. Famous West Virginia natives include actor
            Don Knotts, gymnast Mary Lou Retton and test pilot Chuck Yeager.

                    Between 250 and 150 B.C., the Adena people built what is known as Grave Creek Mound in Marshall County. Now standing 62
                    feet tall with a 240-foot diameter, it is the largest conical burial mound in the United States. In 1838, two men dug
                    their way into the mound, exposing a burial chamber with skeletons and jewelry.

                    Two apple varieties originated in West Virginia: the Grimes Golden apple, discovered on a farm near Wellsburg in the
                    early 19th century; and the Golden Delicious apple, found on a farm in Clay County in the early 20th century. In 1995,
                    the Golden Delicious apple was designated the official state fruit of West Virginia.

                    New River Gorge Bridge, with a span of 1,700 feet, is the longest steel arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere. Every
                    third Saturday in October the Fayetteville bridge hosts a festival that includes hundreds of BASE jumpers plunging 876
                    feet into the river below.

                    In 1942, West Virginia enacted a law that required students and teachers to salute the American flag and recite the
                    Pledge of Allegiance. When Walter Barnette, a Jehovah’s Witness, refused to do so on the grounds that it contradicted
                    his religious beliefs, he was expelled from school. On June 14, 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia
                    State Board of Education v. Barnette that forcing individuals to salute the flag was a violation of their freedom of
                    speech and religion.
