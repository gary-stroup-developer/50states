            Colorado, which joined the union as the 38th state in 1876, is America’s eighth-largest state in terms of landmass.
            Located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States, the state’s abundant and varied natural resources
            attracted the ancient Pueblo peoples and, later, the Plains Indians. First explored by Europeans in the late 1500s (the
            Spanish referred to the region as “Colorado” for its red-colored earth), the area was ceded to the United States in 1848
            with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War (1846-48). In 1858, the discovery of gold in
            Colorado attracted new settlers. During the Plains Indian Wars (1860s-80s), Colorado’s wild frontier was the scene of
            intense fighting between Native Americans and white settlers. In the 21st century, Colorado continues to rely on its
            natural resources as well as agriculture and tourism to sustain its economy.

                    Mesa Verde National Park contains more than 4,000 archaeological sites—including around 600 cliff dwellings—from the
                    Ancestral Puebloans who inhabited the area from about AD 550 to 1300. By the late 13th century, they began to migrate
                    south to New Mexico and Arizona, where their descendants continue to live today.

                    Discovered by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike in 1806 during an expedition to determine the southwestern boundary of the
                    Louisiana Purchase, Pikes Peak became a landmark to the thousands of fortune hunters who traveled west with the slogan
                    “Pikes Peak or Bust” on their wagons after gold was found in the area in 1858.

                    On November 29, 1864, more than 150 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians—believing themselves to be under the
                    protection of the U.S. government—were slaughtered by close to 700 Colorado volunteer soldiers under the command of
                    Colonel John Chivington. The atrocity devastated the tribes and served as a catalyst for years of subsequent warfare
                    between Native American Indians and the U.S. Army.

                    The Colorado Rockies are part of the North American Cordillera, which sweeps the western part of the continent all the
                    way from Alaska into northern Mexico. With 58 named peaks over 14,000 feet and an average altitude of 6,800 feet,
                    Colorado has the highest elevation of all the states.
