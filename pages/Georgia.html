            The largest of the U.S. states east of the Mississippi River and the youngest of the 13 former English colonies, Georgia
            was founded in 1732, at which time its boundaries were even larger—including much of the present-day states of Alabama
            and Mississippi.
            
            By the mid-19th century, Georgia had the greatest number of plantations of any state in the South, and in many respects
            epitomized plantation culture and economic dependence on slavery. In 1864, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman
            invaded Georgia, captured Atlanta and began his infamous March to the Sea, cutting a 200-mile-wide swath of fire and
            destruction reaching all the way to Savannah. Georgia’s landscape varies greatly as it sweeps from the Appalachian
            Mountains in the north to the marshes of the Atlantic coast on the southeast to the Okefenokee Swamp on the south.

                    Although initially conceived of by James Oglethorpe as a refuge for London’s indebted prisoners, Georgia was ultimately
                    established in 1732 to protect South Carolina and other southern colonies from Spanish invasion through Florida.

                <li>
                    Georgia was the first of 10 states to vote against ratification of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote.
                    Even after it became federal law on August 26, 1920, Georgia women were prevented from voting until 1922. The state
                    legislature did not officially ratify the amendment until 1970.

                    The 13th and last of the British colonies, Georgia was the only one to be governed remotely by a Board of Trustees in
                    London for the first 20 years. It was also the only colony to prohibit slavery from its inception—along with lawyers and
                    Roman Catholics.

                    In September of 1906, a massacre broke out in Atlanta after newspaper reports of Black men allegedly assaulting white
                    women. Although the attacks were never confirmed, thousands of angry white men gathered downtown, killing dozens of
                    Black people and causing extensive damage to many Black-owned businesses. The massacre made both national and
                    international headlines and influenced the subsequent statewide passage of prohibition in 1908.
