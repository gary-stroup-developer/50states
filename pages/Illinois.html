            The first Europeans to visit Illinois were the French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, but the
            region was ceded to Britain after the French and Indian War. After the American Revolution, Illinois became a territory
            of the United States, and achieved statehood in 1818. Located on Lake Michigan, and connected to the eastern ports via
            the Erie Canal, Chicago became a booming metropolis, and even the fire of 1871 could not stunt its growth. In the second
            half of the 19th century the great need for workers in the mills, rail yards and slaughterhouses made Chicago a popular
            destination for immigrants and freed blacks. During Prohibition Chicago became synonymous with bootleg liquor and
            gangsters like Al Capone.

                    What began as an ordinary fire in Patrick and Catherine O’Leary’s barn on October 8, 1871, quickly turned into what
                    became known as the Great Chicago Fire, which devastated roughly 18,000 buildings, left close to 100,000 inhabitants
                    homeless and killed between 200 and 300 people.

                    The World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago attracted 27 million visitors during its six-month operation—more
                    than 40 percent of the United States’ total population at the time. Among the many inventions exhibited there was the
                    first Ferris wheel, built to rival the Eiffel Tower that had been built for the Paris Fair in 1889. The 250-foot
                    diameter wheel carried 36 cars with up to 60 riders each.

                    When an angry mob formed outside of the city jail in Springfield on August 14, 1908, seeking revenge against two black
                    men accused of separate crimes against whites, policemen escorted the prisoners out the back door to safety. In the
                    violent riot that ensued, buildings were destroyed and looted and two unrelated black members of the community were
                    lynched. The appalling event led to the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
                    (NAACP) a few months later.
